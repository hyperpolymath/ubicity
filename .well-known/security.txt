# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.3.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| 0.2.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.2   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. **Preferred**: GitHub Security Advisories (private reporting)
   https://github.com/hyperpolymath/ubicity/security/advisories/new
2. **Alternative**: Direct email to maintainer (hyperpolymath@proton.me)
3. **Expected Response**: Within 48 hours
4. **Disclosure Timeline**: 90 days coordinated disclosure

## Security Measures

- **Memory Safety**: WASM (Rust) provides memory safety guarantees
- **Type Safety**: ReScript compile-time types + TypeScript
- **Sandboxing**: WASM runs in isolated linear memory
- **Permissions**: Deno explicit permissions (--allow-read, --allow-write)
- **Data Privacy**: Local-first, no network calls, no telemetry
- **Offline-First**: Works completely air-gapped

## Security-Relevant Features

- No network dependencies (offline-first architecture)
- No external API calls
- No user tracking or analytics
- No third-party CDN dependencies
- All data stays local
- Explicit file system permissions via Deno

## Known Security Considerations

- User data in `./ubicity-data/` should be backed up securely
- Anonymization tools available (see `src/privacy.ts`)
- GPS coordinates can be fuzzed for privacy
- PII removal utilities included

## CVE Process

If a CVE is assigned:
1. We will acknowledge within 24 hours
2. Develop patch within 7-14 days
3. Release security update
4. Publish advisory on GitHub Security
5. Update CHANGELOG.md

## Security Audits

Last audit: Never (v0.3.0 is initial release)
Next planned audit: TBD

## Responsible Disclosure Recognition

Security researchers who follow responsible disclosure will be:
- Credited in CHANGELOG.md (unless anonymous preferred)
- Listed in SECURITY_HALL_OF_FAME.md
- Offered co-authorship on security advisories

## Out of Scope

- Social engineering attacks
- Physical access attacks
- DoS via legitimate resource exhaustion
- Bugs in Deno/Rust/ReScript compilers (report upstream)

This security policy follows RFC 9116 (security.txt)
