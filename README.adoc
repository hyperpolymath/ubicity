> *Making the city itself a learning environment, one captured experience at a time.*

== What Is This?

UbiCity (the Ubiquitous City of Learning) is a vision for dissolving the boundaries between formal education and urban exploration. This repository contains *practical tools* to capture, map, and analyze learning experiences that happen outside traditional institutional boundaries.

Instead of waiting for infrastructure, we're building tools to document urban learning *as it happens* - creating a corpus of learning experiences that can reveal patterns invisible within traditional educational frameworks.

== The Problem

You have an expansive vision (UbiCity) but need concrete next steps. How do you move from concept to practice without:

1. Infinite scope creep
2. Analysis paralysis
3. Building technology before validating the idea
4. Losing the essence in the implementation

== This Solution

*Start with data, not infrastructure.* Capture learning experiences using a minimal protocol, then use analysis tools to discover what patterns emerge organically.

=== What You Get

- 📋 *JSON Schema* - Structured format for learning experiences
- 🎯 *Capture Tool* - CLI for recording experiences in the moment
- 🗺️ *Mapper* - Analysis engine finding connections and patterns
- 📊 *Minimal Viable Protocol* - The simplest possible UbiCity instantiation
- 🔍 *Export to Voyant* - Text analysis integration for deeper insights

== Quick Start

=== Installation

```bash
cd ubicity
npm install  # if needed for dependencies
chmod +x capture.js  # make capture tool executable
```

=== Capture Your First Experience

*Option 1: Quick capture (30 seconds)*
```bash
node capture.js quick
```

*Option 2: Full capture (2 minutes)*
```bash
node capture.js full
```

*Option 3: Generate a template to edit*
```bash
node capture.js template > my-experience.json
= Edit the JSON file, then manually add to ubicity-data/experiences/

```

=== Analyze Your Experiences

*Generate a full report:*
```bash
node mapper.js report
```

*Find learning hotspots:*
```bash
node mapper.js hotspots
```

*View domain connection network:*
```bash
node mapper.js network
```

*Track a learner's journey:*
```bash
node mapper.js learner <learner-id>
```

== The 4-Week Experiment

Want to test if UbiCity works for you? Follow the protocol in `MINIMAL_VIABLE_PROTOCOL.md`:

- *Week 1*: Capture 5 learning experiences in different locations
- *Week 2*: Run analysis, look for patterns
- *Week 3*: Decide to stop or add one collaborator
- *Week 4*: Meet and discuss, capture that collaboration

*Success criteria*: If you found one unexpected connection and generated one new question, UbiCity works at minimum viable scale.

== Data Model

=== Core Structure (MVP)

Every learning experience needs:

```json
{
  "learner": {
    "id": "who learned"
  },
  "context": {
    "location": {
      "name": "where they learned"
    }
  },
  "experience": {
    "type": "what kind of learning",
    "description": "what they learned"
  }
}
```

=== Optional Enrichment

Add any of these to deepen analysis:

- *Learner background/interests* - For finding similar learners
- *GPS coordinates* - For spatial mapping
- *Situation/connections* - Who else was involved
- *Domains* - Disciplinary areas (enables interdisciplinary analysis)
- *Artifacts* - Photos, sketches, code created
- *Outcome* - Success/failure, new questions, unexpected connections
- *Tags/privacy* - Organization and access control

Full schema: `schema/learning-experience.json`

== Analysis Capabilities

The mapper provides several analytical lenses:

=== 1. Interdisciplinary Connections

Find experiences that span multiple domains:

```javascript
mapper.findInterdisciplinaryConnections()
```

Returns learning moments where different disciplines met, often yielding unexpected insights.

=== 2. Learning Hotspots

Identify locations with high disciplinary diversity:

```javascript
mapper.findLearningHotspots()
```

These are places where the city itself facilitates cross-domain learning.

=== 3. Domain Networks

See which disciplines frequently co-occur:

```javascript
mapper.generateDomainNetwork()
```

Reveals the natural boundaries (or lack thereof) between fields in practice.

=== 4. Learner Journeys

Track how individuals' interests evolve:

```javascript
mapper.getLearnerJourney(learnerId)
```

Shows progression, new domains discovered, questions emerged.

=== 5. Location Mapping

Understand the learning characteristics of places:

```javascript
mapper.mapByLocation()
```

How many different disciplines meet at each location? How many unique learners?

== Use Cases

=== For Individuals
- Document self-directed learning
- Find patterns in your interests
- Justify learning time to yourself/others
- Create a learning portfolio

=== For Small Groups
- Track collaborative learning
- Find intersection of interests
- Identify productive meeting locations
- Build shared knowledge maps

=== For Researchers
- Study informal learning patterns
- Analyze urban learning environments
- Generate papers from captured data
- Validate educational theories in practice

=== For Institutions
- Understand learning outside classroom
- Find community partners
- Document experiential learning
- Support lifelong learners

== Integration with Existing Tools

=== Zotero Connection

This repo started as a Zotero → Voyant exporter. The connection:

- *Zotero*: Captures research reading and sources
- *UbiCity*: Captures experiential learning and practice
- *Voyant*: Analyzes text patterns in both

You can export UbiCity experiences to Voyant:

```javascript
const mapper = new UrbanKnowledgeMapper();
mapper.loadAll();
const corpus = mapper.exportToVoyant();
// Upload corpus to Voyant for text analysis
```

=== Other Integrations

- *Echomesh*: Context preservation across time
- *JanusKey*: Reversible operations for experimental learning
- *Oblíbený*: Type-safe learning protocols
- *MAA Framework*: Accountability in public learning spaces

== Scaling Considerations

=== Don't Scale Until You Have 50+ Experiences

Seriously. Capture data first. Then:

1. *Add visualization* - Map experiences geographically
2. *Add recommendations* - "Learners like you also explored..."
3. *Add mobile capture* - Quick smartphone entry
4. *Add social features* - Share discoveries
5. *Add institutional integration* - Course credit, portfolios

But each of these is *optional*. The core works with just the CLI tools.

== Design Principles

=== 1. *Capture First, Analyze Later*
Minimize friction in the moment. Rich analysis can wait.

=== 2. *Privacy by Default*
Pseudonymous learner IDs. Privacy levels. Opt-in sharing.

=== 3. *Failures Are Data*
Experiments that fail still generate valuable learning experiences.

=== 4. *Location Matters*
Where you learn shapes what you learn. The city is co-teacher.

=== 5. *Interdisciplinary by Nature*
Cities don't respect academic boundaries. Neither should learning.

=== 6. *Incomplete Is Better Than Perfect*
A sketchy capture is better than waiting for perfect data.

=== 7. *Tools, Not Platforms*
Composable tools you control, not a locked-in platform.

== Project Philosophy

This is *not a startup*. Not a platform. Not a product.

This is *infrastructure for a practice* - like a yoga mat or a notebook.

UbiCity isn't something to complete. It's a continuous process:

- You capture experiences
- Patterns emerge
- You explore those patterns
- New questions arise
- You capture more experiences
- Patterns evolve

The tools here support that cycle. They don't try to optimize it, gamify it, or monetize it.

== Connection to Your Other Work

=== Formal Methods
- Learning experiences as verifiable events
- Safety properties: learner wellbeing, privacy
- Verification conditions for "successful learning"

=== Solidarity Economics
- Learning as commons, not commodity
- Mutual accountability in public learning
- Skills-sharing over credentials

=== Phase-Separated Development
- MVP protocol provides clear phase boundaries
- Each week of experiment is a phase
- Natural pause points prevent scope creep

=== Seven Tentacles Framework
- Character-driven narrative of learning journeys
- Urban spaces as characters in learning story
- Multi-threaded exploration of ideas

== Next Steps

=== If This Resonates (Immediate)

1. Read `MINIMAL_VIABLE_PROTOCOL.md`
2. Capture one experience right now
3. Decide: 4-week experiment or not?

=== If You Want to Extend (Month 2+)

1. Add visualization (D3.js maps of learning)
2. Create web interface (form + map view)
3. Integrate with Zotero (reading → practice)
4. Write paper: "Formal Verification of Urban Learning Systems"

=== If This Becomes a Life Project

1. Establish quarterly 4-week cycles
2. Each cycle explores new aspect
3. Publish findings after each cycle
4. Tools evolve based on real usage
5. Community emerges organically

== Contributing

This is a personal exploration toolkit, but if UbiCity resonates with you:

- Capture your own experiences
- Share patterns you discover
- Extend the tools for your context
- Write about your experiments

The GPL3 license means you can fork, modify, and share freely.

== Credits

- *Concept*: UbiCity vision from 2017+ work with UAL Creative Communities
- *Implementation*: Built on learnings from zotero-voyant-export project
- *Inspiration*: Voyant (text analysis), Zotero (research management), and years of trying to formalize the informal

== License

GPL3 - Same as the original zotero-voyant-export project.

Learning should be free as in freedom.
